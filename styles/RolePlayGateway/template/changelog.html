Each are case-sensitive, have no closing tag, and allow for the insertion of a custom display of each entity type in any part of your roleplay.  Groups, for example, can now be <a href="http://www.roleplaygateway.com/roleplay/the-multiverse/places/the-lahmian-estate/">embedded in place pages</a>.</li>
